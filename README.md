![SmartDoc](https://github.com/AndMu/SmartDoc/blob/master/src/SmartDoc/Views/SplashScreen/Splash.png)

SmartDoc is a really smart way of automatically organizing your documents library â€“ from PDF books to scanned documents and research papers.	Using Machine learning it can learn your existing library structure and without any effort seamlessly classify new documents into existing folders. You can setup SmartDoc to monitor incoming directory and it will propose where document should be moved. SmartDoc supports multiple formats (pdf, Microsoft word, text files) and can be used to automatically classify new or unclassified documents/books/papers into your existing library.
